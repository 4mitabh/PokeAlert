Tuesday January 24h 2017 PokeAlert received a Cease and Desist letter from The Pokemon Company International.

This Cease and Desist Letter included the request to remove The Pokemon Company International, Inc copyrighted images which I have now complied with but unfortunately this was not enough for me to continue maintaining PokeAlert.

I regret to inform you that I will no longer be maintaining PokeAlert

A big thank you to everyone for having chosen PokeAlert for your Pokemon quest endeavour, hope you guys enjoyed the app!

Note: PokeAlert is a "stand-alone" application. This means that it doesn't need any external server to function and thereofere cannot remotely be shut it down.
